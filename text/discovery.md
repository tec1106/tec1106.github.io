# Discovery
Leveraging their curiosity and strategic thinking, they seek to discover desirable, usable, feasible, and viable products.  
By running continuous experiments with their team, they validate hypotheses, reduce risks, and use data-driven insights to guide decisions, always aiming to turn the unknown into actionable results.

## Level 1–4: Basic
- They show curiosity but often struggle to connect ideas or identify opportunities for discovery.
- They have some understanding of how to conduct experiments to validate hypotheses or reduce risks.
- They often rely on assumptions rather than data-driven insights to guide decisions, leading to unclear outcomes.
- They focus more on immediate tasks than on exploring long-term discovery goals or aligning with broader team or business objectives.

## Level 5–8: Intermediate
- They demonstrate curiosity and the ability to connect strategic thinking with discovering desirable and viable products.
- They collaborate with their team to design and run experiments that validate hypotheses and reduce risks, though they may still need guidance to refine processes.
- They use data-driven insights in decision-making but may occasionally rely on assumptions or struggle to translate unknowns into clear, actionable results.
- They balance short-term execution with long-term discovery goals but sometimes need support ensuring alignment with broader team or business strategies.

## Level 9–10: Expert
- They fully leverage curiosity and strategic thinking to identify and pursue discovery opportunities that lead to desirable, usable, feasible, and viable products.
- They confidently run continuous, well-designed experiments with their team, validating hypotheses, reducing risks, and using insights to guide critical decisions.
- They consistently rely on data-driven insights to turn unknowns into actionable results, maintaining a strong focus on long-term discovery objectives.
- They inspire and lead their team in driving discovery, ensuring that every decision contributes to both immediate and broader business goals, while continuously aligning discovery efforts with the overall product vision.
